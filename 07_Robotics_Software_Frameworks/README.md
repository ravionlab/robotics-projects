# Robotics Software Frameworks

## Overview
Robotics software frameworks provide structured environments for developing, testing, and deploying robot applications. These frameworks offer standardized interfaces, communication mechanisms, and tools that enable developers to create modular, reusable, and scalable robotics software. This section explores the most widely used robotics software frameworks, with a focus on ROS (Robot Operating System) and its successor, ROS2.

## Content Structure
This section is organized into two main subsections:
1. [ROS](./7.1_ROS/README.md) - The classic Robot Operating System
2. [ROS2](./7.2_ROS2/README.md) - The next-generation Robot Operating System

## Key Concepts in Robotics Software Frameworks

### Framework Architecture
- **Distributed Computing**: Managing processes across multiple computers
- **Communication Middleware**: Enabling data exchange between components
- **Component Models**: Structuring code into reusable modules
- **Abstraction Layers**: Hiding hardware details behind common interfaces
- **Development Tools**: Supporting the software development lifecycle

### Core Capabilities
- **Inter-Process Communication**: Message passing, services, actions
- **Hardware Abstraction**: Drivers and interfaces for sensors and actuators
- **Data Visualization**: Tools for monitoring and debugging
- **Simulation Integration**: Testing in virtual environments
- **Package Management**: Organizing and distributing code
