# Reinforcement Learning & AI Integration

## Overview
Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides robots with the ability to learn optimal behaviors through interaction with their environment. This section explores RL methods and their application to robotics, from fundamental algorithms to deep learning approaches and real-world implementations.

## Content Structure
This section is organized into two main subsections:
1. [Basic RL](./6.1_Basic_RL/README.md) - Foundational concepts and algorithms
2. [Deep RL](./6.2_Deep_RL/README.md) - Neural network based approaches

## Key Concepts
