# Robot Locomotion

## Overview
Locomotion is the study of how robots move through their environment. This section covers the fundamental principles, mechanisms, and control strategies that enable various types of robot mobility, focusing on wheeled and legged locomotion systems.

## Content Structure
This section is organized into two main subsections:
1. [Wheeled Robots](./5.1_Wheeled_Robots/README.md) - Motion using wheels and treads
2. [Legged Robots](./5.2_Legged_Robots/README.md) - Motion using articulated legs

## Key Concepts

### Locomotion Fundamentals
- **Degrees of Freedom**: Possible directions of independent movement
- **Holonomic vs. Non-holonomic**: Constraints on system movement
- **Static vs. Dynamic Stability**: Balance requirements during motion
- **Energy Efficiency**: Optimizing movement for power consumption
- **Terrain Adaptability**: Ability to handle different surfaces and obstacles

### Mobility Models
- **Kinematic Models**: Geometric relationships without considering forces
- **Dynamic Models**: Incorporating mass, inertia, and external forces
- **Contact Models**: Interaction between robot and environment
- **Traction Models**: Handling slippage and friction constraints
- **Actuator Models**: Motor capabilities and limitations

### Motion Planning
- **Path Planning**: Finding suitable routes through the environment
- **Trajectory Generation**: Creating time-parameterized motion profiles
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Strategies for detecting and avoiding collisions
- **Gait Planning**: Sequence of movements for legged systems
- **Energy-Optimal Planning**: Minimizing energy consumption

### Control Strategies
- **Position Control**: Following predetermined paths
- **Velocity Control**: Maintaining desired speeds
- **Force/Torque Control**: Managing interaction with the environment
- **Compliance Control**: Adapting to environmental contact
- **Learning-Based Control**: Using data to improve performance

## Comparison of Locomotion Methods

| Characteristic | Wheeled Locomotion | Legged Locomotion |
|----------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Speed | Generally faster on flat terrain | Moderate, varies with gait |
| Efficiency | High efficiency on smooth surfaces | Lower efficiency due to complex mechanisms |
| Terrain Handling | Limited to relatively smooth surfaces | Can navigate rough, uneven terrain |
| Obstacle Clearance | Limited by wheel diameter | Can step over obstacles |
| Mechanical Complexity | Relatively simple | Complex with many joints and actuators |
| Control Complexity | Relatively straightforward | Complex, especially for dynamic gaits |
| Stability | Inherently stable with 3+ wheels | Requires active balance control |
