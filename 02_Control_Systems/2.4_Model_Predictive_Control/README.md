# Model Predictive Control (MPC)

## Overview
Model Predictive Control (MPC) is an advanced control technique that uses a dynamic model of the system to predict future behavior over a finite time horizon. At each time step, MPC solves an optimization problem to determine the control inputs that minimize a cost function while satisfying constraints. This approach allows robots to anticipate future events, handle complex dynamics, and explicitly account for system limitations, making it highly effective for challenging control tasks.

## Key Concepts

### Fundamental Principles
- **Receding Horizon**: Implementing only the first step of the computed control sequence
- **Prediction Model**: Mathematical representation of system behavior
- **Cost Function**: Objective to be minimized (tracking error, control effort, etc.)
- **Constraints**: Limitations on states, inputs, and outputs
- **Optimization**: Finding the control sequence that minimizes the cost function
- **Feedback Control**: Re-solving at each time step to incorporate measurements

### Problem Formulation
- **State-Space Model**: ẋ = f(x, u) or discrete x(k+1) = f(x(k), u(k))
- **Prediction Horizon**: Number of future steps considered (N)
- **Control Horizon**: Number of steps for which control inputs are optimized
- **Terminal Conditions**: Special constraints or costs at the end of the horizon
- **Reference Trajectory**: Desired system behavior over the horizon
- **Stage Costs**: Costs associated with each step in the horizon

### Optimization Problem
- **Decision Variables**: Future control inputs u(k), u(k+1), ..., u(k+N-1)
- **Objective Function**: Typically sum of stage costs plus terminal cost
- **Equality Constraints**: System dynamics, terminal conditions
